# Morse Code Overview

## What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a system of communication that represents letters, numbers, and punctuation using sequences of dots (•) and dashes (—). It was originally designed for telegraph transmissions but remains relevant in radio communication, aviation, and emergency signaling.

## Historical Context
Morse code was developed in the 1830s by Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Vail as a means of transmitting messages over long distances via telegraph. Before its invention, communication was slow, relying on physical mail or messengers. The introduction of Morse code revolutionized communication, allowing near-instantaneous transmission of information.

## How Morse Code Works
Each letter and number is assigned a unique combination of dots and dashes. Short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes) are transmitted in sequences to form words. For example:
- **A** → `•-`
- **B** → `-•••`
- **C** → `-•-•`
- **SOS** (distress signal) → `•••---•••`

Morse code can be transmitted using sound, light, or electrical pulses, making it versatile for various communication methods.

## Examples of Words in Morse Code
Here are some examples of words translated into Morse code:
- **HELLO** → `•••• • •-•• •-•• ---`
- **WORLD** → `•-- --- •-• •-•• -••`
- **CODE** → `-•-• --- -•• •`

Morse code remains an essential tool in emergency situations and is still used by amateur radio operators today - wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Learn-Morse-Code).

Evolution of Morse Code
So, Morse code worked in America—but what happens when you take it global? Cue the drama. Turns out, the original American Morse Code was kind of a hot mess. It worked fine for railroads and local telegraphs, but once other countries started using it? Chaos. Imagine everyone trying to text with slightly different emojis.

Here’s the deal: American Morse Code had quirks. For example, some letters had weird spacing inside their codes (like the letter “C”), which confused the heck out of international operators. It was like Morse and Vail built a cool DIY go-kart, but forgot to add brakes. Fun for them, terrifying for everyone else.

Enter International Morse Code (aka the “Everyone Chill” update). In 1851, at a conference in Berlin, Europe was like, “We need one code to rule them all.” They stripped out the janky spacing, standardized the timing, and tweaked symbols to work better with different languages. For example, the number “0” went from being a long dash-fest in American code to a sleek five-dash sequence internationally. It was like switching from a dial-up modem to broadband.
